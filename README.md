# Anviksha AI: Advanced Medical Diagnostic Infrastructure

Anviksha AI is a professional-grade medical diagnostic platform powered by the Gemini 3.0 and Gemini 3 Flash neural processing engines. The system is engineered to provide high-precision clinical analysis for multiple diagnostic modalities, including Radiography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), and Electrocardiography (ECG).

The platform bridges the gap between frontier artificial intelligence and clinical diagnostic workflows, focusing on accuracy, speed, and professional UI/UX standards.

## Technical Capabilities

### Neural Imaging Analysis
Specialized diagnostic cores designed for high-fidelity interpretation of medical imagery:
*   **Radiography (X-Ray)**: Analysis of parenchymal opacities, pneumothorax, and cardiovascular silhouettes.
*   **Neuro-Imaging (MRI)**: Signal abnormality detection in T1/T2/FLAIR sequences.
*   **Body Imaging (CT)**: Evaluation of tissue density, hemorrhage, and mass effects.
*   **Cardiology (ECG)**: Visual measurement of PR, QRS, and QT intervals with acute ischemia flagging.

### Clinical Triage and Assessment
Comprehensive symptomatic evaluation utilizing advanced risk-scoring algorithms to determine diagnostic priority and referral pathways.

### Pharmaceutical Intelligence
Real-time mapping of branded medications to their generic equivalents within the Indian pharmaceutical ecosystem, including objective cost-benefit analysis.

### Clinical Psychology Support
A dedicated module providing compassionate, psychological assistance and mental wellness guidance through natural language processing.

### Data Ecosystem
Secure, localized storage architecture for longitudinal tracking of medical scans and clinical reports.
